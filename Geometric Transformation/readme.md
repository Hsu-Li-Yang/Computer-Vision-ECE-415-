# Geometric Transformation
This is an demo for geometric transformation in computer vision
It might help you to review the basic computer vision theory

## Homogeneous coordinate
When vectors only differ by scale, they are considered to be eqivalent.
We can convert homogeneous coordinate back into inhomogeeous coordinate by dividing through by the last element w
